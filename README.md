# RBG game specific reasoners

A few highly opitmized game reasoners.

This is a part of the Regular Boardgames General Game Playing system.
See the official repository: <https://github.com/marekesz/rbg>.

Implementation is compatible with code generated by [RBG compiler](https://github.com/uicus/rbg2cpp).

### Available games
* breakthrough
* connect4
* english draughts
* english draughts (split)
* reversi

### Testing
Use script `run_benchmark.sh` to compile and run flat-MC test with statistics.

Usage:
```
./run_benchamark [game] [time] [random_generator]
```
`game` - the name of the game\
`time` - time in miliseconds (without preprocessing)\
`random_generator` - random generator id
* 0 -- `std::mt19937` with Lemire's method (unbiased)
* 1 -- `std::mt19937` with `std::uniform_int_distribution` (the standard unbiased method)
* 2 -- Java's algorithm (lcg48, unbiased)
* 3 -- lcg48 with multiplication method (biased)
* 4 -- xorShift64 with multiplication method (biased)

Then you can run test again: `./[game] [time]`

Running tests for all games is also possible: `./run_all_benchmarks.sh [time]`
